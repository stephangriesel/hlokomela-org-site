            <p>
              With the global COVID-19 pandemic now spreading quickly in South
              Africa, local communities are feeling the devastating effects of
              the virus. With the South African tourism industry being hit
              hardest by the outbreak, many people have lost their jobs due to
              the lockdown measures. We are committed to continue offering
              health & safety support to these vulnerable communities for as
              long as this pandemic remains, but Hlokomela needs your help to do
              this.

            <p>
              Limpopo is one of the worst areas in South Africa for poverty,
              whilst lacking basic facilities in the local villages such as
              running water. Hlokomela is an established non-profit clinic
              committed to serving farm workers and their families. Our goal is
              to provide a cost-effective and sustainable way to screen for and
              treat breast cancer, preventing hundreds of deaths each year.
