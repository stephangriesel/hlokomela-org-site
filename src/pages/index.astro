            <p class="text-center">
              Hlokomela was established in 2005 in response to research that
              highlighted a critical need for health care among farm workers and
              other vulnerable populations in the greater Hoedspruit area. Since
              then, Hlokomela has been a prominent and respected role player in
              the health and well-being of the local community, serving about 60
              000 people annually (direct and indirect beneficiaries).

            <h2 class="font-bold">WHO WE BECAME</h2>
            <p class="text-center">
              In 2020, faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, Hlokomela capitalised
              on its identity which has been built up over 15 years of caring.
              Hlokomela showed its mettle by stepping up and leading the
              COVID-19 response in Hoedspruit, Limpopo as well as in other areas
              of the Mopani District where the organisation implements
              programmes. We were strengthened even more as the organisation and
              its staff were challenged in an extra-ordinary time to do
              extra-ordinary things to maintain the high level of service
              Hlokomela is known for. All this was achieved at the same time
              staff and researchers worked hard at piloting a partial payment
              system that would hopefully secure the financial viability of the
              organisation once implemented in full.

            <p class="text-center">
              Farms in the Mopani District not only employ permanent workers,
              but also a large number of seasonal workers during picking
              seasons. Many of these seasonal workers are migrants from other
              areas of South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere in
              Southern Africa. Hlokomela currently provides services to workers
              and their families on 71 sub project sites in the Hoedspruit
              community, as well as to a number of employees on private nature
              reserves adjacent to the Kruger National Park. An estimated 25 000
              farm workers and their families benefit directly from Hlokomela
              services. Each month, Hlokomela helps approximately 1 700 clients
              access HIV Testing Services (HTS), and helps 2 000 people living
              with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) at three Wellness
              Clinic sites and 7 mobile sites (Hlokomela, Bavaria, Richmond,
              Klaserie Private Nature Reserve, Ngala, Thornybush Waterside,
              South African Wildlife College, Singita Lebombo, Phelwana and
              Timbavati Foundation). Hlokomela’s public awareness campaigns
              provide information about HIV and AIDS to the entire community.
